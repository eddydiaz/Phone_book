#ITLA PhoneBook

This is an academic assignment created by eddymanueldiazgarcia for his students at Las Americas Institute of technology (www.itla.edu.do).

The objective of this assignment is to test student's ability to create their own implementation of the linked list abstract data type and file handling.

Eclipse Mars 2 for C++ (MAC) was used for creating the project (eclipse project file have been included). But the code should compile with any IDE regardless of the operating system. Our code takes care of multiplatform specific details.

Should you have any question about this code please feel free to contact rperera@itla.edu.do
